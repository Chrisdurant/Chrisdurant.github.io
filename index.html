            <p>
                Many students and employees are upset about how each day the shuttle's time differs and is not constant which delays them. Variables that contribute to this problem include the drivers schedule, stopped trains, and conditions on the highways. To help combat this, we plan to create an application that tracks the location of shuttleâ€™s and time as accurately as possible so our users know what time the shuttle is coming and they can use this information to decide if they should choose another source of transportation that day.
